1. Problem Statement

Millions of students in India, especially from underprivileged or rural backgrounds, lack the financial support and motivation to pursue continuous skill development. Traditional scholarships are limited, merit-based, bureaucratic, and often inaccessible to the average learner. Moreover, there is no real-time reward system for milestone-based learning, community contribution, or personal growth.

2. Proposed Solution

A UPI-powered, AI-driven micro-scholarship platform that offers small, milestone-based financial rewards to students who complete specific learning tasks, social projects, or career-development goals. Rewards range from ₹500 to ₹1000 for verified achievements. The platform crowdsources funding from CSR initiatives, individual donors, alumni, and NGOs.
